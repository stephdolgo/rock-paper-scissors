# rock-paper-scissors

A simple game of rock, paper, scissors using HTML, CSS, and JS. 
In Part 1, I practiced:
- using multiple js functions to create an app
- for loop and if/else
- learned about backticks with template literals to make code more legible
- Math.random and Math.floor to pull a random game selection from 3 choices
- using an array vs. a switch case to select for rock, paper, scissors
