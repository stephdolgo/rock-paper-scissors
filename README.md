# rock-paper-scissors

This is a refresher project on Javascript for myself after mostly relying on JQuery in the past. 

**Task:** Build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a UI from the Odin Project with my own spin on it.
**Concept:** Scifi-inspired, I wanted to make a futuristic UI that I used to explore Canvas with as I never had done so before. 
While the canvas component is imperfect, it was a worthwhile challenge that helped me think in terms of JS classes.

**Design:**
Created a mobile and desktop layout in Figma. The image below is the final desktop/tablet layout. Initially, there was a space for where the computers selection would go in; however, showing an indicator on the players and computers selection within the same space had better flow and utilized the space better.
